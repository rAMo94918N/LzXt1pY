# We set commands.c's merge driver to `binary` so when it conflicts during a
# merge git will leave the local version unmodified. This way our Makefile
# will rebuild it based on src/commands/*.json before trying to compile it.
# Otherwise the file gets modified and gets the same timestamp as the .json
src/commands.c merge=binary
